## Quick note: some of these additions were later changed by other members and/or unused for our game, so I will upload the original code I did for them. My following contributions to our game Sol Tenebrae:

### Puzzle 1 - I would've commented on these but I've lost access to the code as it has been removed, and these were the only images I had. Basically, the player is presented with 3 levers. They have to press them in correct order, which is hinted at in our journal screen. If the order is done correctly, the gate opens - enemies spawn if wrong (this was missing).

### Puzzle 2 - The final lever: correct order opens the door via UE4's Sequencer tool.
